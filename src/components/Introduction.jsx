        <p>
          I started my career as an software engineer in web development nearly two years ago and
          worked as a full-stack software engineer on recent projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of that, I became to have a general knowledge with hands-on experience in front-end,
          back-end and system operations. I'm quite confident that I can quickly catch up with languages, technologies and tools in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career goal is to become a thoughtful software engineer and deliver high quality product.
